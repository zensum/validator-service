## Debug in VSCode

Go to your debugger and launch `Debug Docker` _(or just press F5)_ and start debugging! 🎉 _It will start the containers in `docker-compose.yml` and attach debuggers to `service`._ __VSCode Magic 🧙🏼‍♂️__

Now everything will be restarted and rebuilt when a .py file is changed. Enjoy!
